Title: Implement End-to-End Data Processing Workflow for E-commerce Platform Using Azure Logic Apps

Description:

Objective: Develop an Azure Logic App workflow to monitor, process, and store data from Azure Blob Storage, external REST APIs, and various Azure services for an e-commerce platform.

Steps:

1. Trigger: Azure Blob Storage Connector
  
  - Monitor the "NewOrders" folder in Azure Blob Storage for new order files.
	
2. Data Retrieval: HTTP Connector
  
  - Fetch customer data from the CRM REST API to enrich order information.
	
3. Data Storage: Azure MySQL Connector
  
  - Store order details and customer information into an Azure MySQL database.
	
4. Messaging: Service Bus Connector
  
  - Send order notifications to an Azure Service Bus Queue for further processing.
	
5. Asynchronous Processing: Azure Queue Storage Connector
  
  - Implement asynchronous order processing using Azure Queue Storage.
	
6. Processing Logic: Azure Functions Connector
  
  - Trigger an Azure Function to process orders from the Azure Queue Storage Queue.
  
7. Event Logging: Azure Event Hubs Connector
  
  - Log order processing events and send data to Azure Event Hubs for real-time monitoring.
  
8. Alerting: Event Grid Connector
  
  - Monitor order processing events in Azure Event Hubs and send alerts using Azure Event Grid.
  
9. Data Storage: Azure Table Storage Connector
  
  - Store processed orders or event logs in Azure Table Storage.
  
10. Secret Management: Azure Key Vault Connector
  
  - Retrieve and use API keys or sensitive information from Azure Key Vault for secure integration.
  
11. Data Lake Storage: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Connector
  
  - Utilize Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for storing and analyzing large volumes of processed order data.
  
Expected Outcome:
  
  - Implement an efficient and scalable data processing workflow in Azure Logic Apps tailored for an e-commerce platform.
  - Achieve seamless integration between Azure services to streamline order processing and enhance customer experience.
