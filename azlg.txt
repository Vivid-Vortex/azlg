Title: Implement End-to-End Data Processing Workflow Using Azure Logic Apps

Description:

Objective: Develop an Azure Logic App workflow to monitor, process, and store data from Azure Blob Storage, external REST APIs, and various Azure services.

Steps:

1.  Trigger: Azure Blob Storage Connector
  
  - Monitor a designated folder in Azure Blob Storage for new files.
	
2. Data Retrieval: HTTP Connector
  
  - Fetch additional data from an external REST API if required.
	
3.   Data Storage: Azure MySQL Connector
  
  - Store file content and additional data into an Azure MySQL database.
	
4.   Messaging: Service Bus Connector
  
  - Send a message to an Azure Service Bus Queue for further processing.
	
5.  Asynchronous Processing: Azure Queue Storage Connector
  
  - Implement asynchronous messaging and queuing using Azure Queue Storage.
	
6.   Processing Logic: Azure Functions Connector
  
  - Trigger an Azure Function to process messages from the Azure Queue Storage Queue.
  
7.	Event Logging: Azure Event Hubs Connector
  
  - Log processing events and send data to Azure Event Hubs for real-time monitoring.
  
8.	Alerting: Event Grid Connector
  
  - Monitor processing events in Azure Event Hubs and send alerts using Azure Event Grid.
  
9.	Data Storage: Azure Table Storage Connector
  
  - Store processed data or event logs in Azure Table Storage.
  
10.	Secret Management: Azure Key Vault Connector
  
  - Retrieve and use secrets or sensitive information from Azure Key Vault.
  
11.	Data Lake Storage: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Connector
  
  - Utilize Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for storing and analyzing large volumes of processed data.
  
	Expected Outcome:
  
  - Implement an efficient and scalable data processing workflow in Azure Logic Apps.
  - Achieve seamless integration between Azure services for end-to-end data processing.
