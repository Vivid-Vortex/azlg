Title: Implement End-to-End Data Processing Workflow for E-commerce Platform Using Azure Logic Apps

Description:

Objective: Develop an Azure Logic App workflow to monitor, process, and store data from Azure Blob Storage, external REST APIs, and various Azure services for an e-commerce platform.

Steps:

1. Trigger: Azure Blob Storage Connector
  
  - Monitor the "NewOrders" folder in Azure Blob Storage for new order files.
	
2. Data Retrieval: HTTP Connector
  
  - Fetch customer data from the CRM REST API to enrich order information.
	
3. Data Storage: Azure MySQL Connector
  
  - Store order details and customer information into an Azure MySQL database.
	
4. Messaging: Service Bus Connector
  
  - Send order notifications to an Azure Service Bus Queue for further processing.
	
5. Asynchronous Processing: Azure Queue Storage Connector
  
  - Implement asynchronous order processing using Azure Queue Storage.
	
6. Processing Logic: Azure Functions Connector
  
  - Trigger an Azure Function to process orders from the Azure Queue Storage Queue.
  
7. Event Logging: Azure Event Hubs Connector
  
  - Log order processing events and send data to Azure Event Hubs for real-time monitoring.
  
8. Alerting: Event Grid Connector
  
  - Monitor order processing events in Azure Event Hubs and send alerts using Azure Event Grid.
  
9. Data Storage: Azure Table Storage Connector
  
  - Store processed orders or event logs in Azure Table Storage.
  
10. Secret Management: Azure Key Vault Connector
  
  - Retrieve and use API keys or sensitive information from Azure Key Vault for secure integration.
  
11. Data Lake Storage: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Connector
  
  - Utilize Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for storing and analyzing large volumes of processed order data.
  
Expected Outcome:
  
  - Implement an efficient and scalable data processing workflow in Azure Logic Apps tailored for an e-commerce platform.
  - Achieve seamless integration between Azure services to streamline order processing and enhance customer experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Step 6 (Azure functions app processing):
1. Process all the orders using Azure Function apps and sent the final order details to Azure Table Storage.
2. New workflow will be triggerd as soon as the data ingested into the azure table storage.
3. Azure Event Hubs Connector - for logging the processed orders data fetched from the azure table storage and real time monitoring.
4. Event Grid Connector - Based on the events generated from the last step of Azure Event Hub connector, 
Use the event grid to send the orders data to the snoflake.

Snoflake oauth connection:-

JDBC connector -

Issue - JDBC connector type is only supported for standard logic app
